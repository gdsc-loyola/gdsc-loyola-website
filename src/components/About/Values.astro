				Google Developer Student Clubs Loyola is a student tech organization
				based in Ateneo de Manila University. We believe that you do not have to
				code to be a developer. As an organization, we not only develop products
				but also people by giving them access to different Google technologies,
				workshops, and opportunities. Made of dreamers, problem solvers, and
				thinkers, we are united by a passion to uplift communities through
				technology together.
				<b> We're doing this through three pillars.</b>
